# Amazon Sales SQL Analysis

This project analyzes Amazon sales data using MySQL. The dataset contains order details such as category, amount, status, and shipping information. Key SQL tasks include filtering records, grouping for revenue insights, joins for region mapping, subqueries for advanced analysis, creating views for summaries, and adding indexes for performance.

### Tasks Performed
- Basic queries (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, GROUP BY)
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Subqueries
- Views & Indexing

Run the queries using `task3_amazon_sales.sql` in MySQL Workbench.
